## Very Much Frequently Asked Questions ❓

### How much doge can exist? – So many puppies! 🐕
Early 2015 (approximately a year and a half after release) there were
approximately 100,000,000,000 coins.
Each subsequent block will grant 10,000 coins to encourage miners to continue to
secure the network and make up for lost wallets on hard drives/phones/lost
encryption passwords/etc.


### Such mining information ⛏

Dogecoin uses a simplified variant of the scrypt key derivation function as its
proof of work with a target time of one minute per block and difficulty
readjustment after every block. The block rewards are fixed and halve every
100,000 blocks. Starting with the 600,000th block, a permanent reward of
10,000 Dogecoin per block will be issued.  

Originally, a different payout scheme was envisioned with block rewards being
determined by taking the maximum reward as per the block schedule and applying
the result of a Mersenne Twister pseudo-random number generator to arrive at a
number between 0 and the maximum reward.

This was changed starting with block 145,000, to prevent large pools from gaming
the system and mining only high reward blocks. At the same time, the difficulty
retargeting was also changed from four hours to once per block (every minute),
implementing an algorithm courtesy of the DigiByte Coin development team, to
lessen the impact of sudden increases and decreases of network hashing rate.

**The current block reward schedule:**

1–99,999: 0–1,000,000 Dogecoin

100,000–144,999: 0–500,000 Dogecoin

145,000–199,999: 250,000 Dogecoin

200,000–299,999: 125,000 Dogecoin

300,000–399,999: 62,500 Dogecoin

400,000–499,999: 31,250 Dogecoin

500,000–599,999: 15,625 Dogecoin
